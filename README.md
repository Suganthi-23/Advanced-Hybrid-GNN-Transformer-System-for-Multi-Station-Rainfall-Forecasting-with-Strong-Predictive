# Hybrid GNN-Transformer System for Multi-Station Rainfall Forecasting

I built this project to solve a key limitation in traditional rainfall prediction systems, where most approaches rely on single-station data or purely temporal models that fail to capture spatial dependencies between locations.

I designed and developed a hybrid spatio-temporal AI system that models both spatial relationships across weather stations and temporal weather patterns. I implemented a Graph Neural Network architecture (GCN + GAT) to learn dynamic interactions between stations and integrated it with a Transformer model to capture long-range temporal dependencies.

To improve prediction stability, I incorporated feature extraction techniques on multi-station meteorological data, enabling more consistent and reliable outputs.

Compared to conventional statistical and LSTM-based models, my approach improves predictive performance by explicitly combining spatial and temporal learning. The model achieves MAE ≈ 2.7 mm and RMSE ≈ 6.6 mm, supported by detailed evaluation including prediction vs actual analysis, residual distributions, and time-series forecasts.

This project reflects a strong focus on building reliable, interpretable, and deployment-ready AI systems for high-performance solutions for real-world climate prediction problem applications.
